Here’s my project for ‘Task 5 - Advanced Data Visualization.’

In this project, I used a dataset from Kaggle: Video Game Sales(kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data).
	•	First, in the Python script, I imported the “vgsales.csv” file, cleaned the data and created 2D, 3D and heatmap visualizations using plotly.express.
	•	After that, I saved the processed data as an Excel file named “for PowerBI.xlsx” to enhance the visuals in Power BI.
	•	Then, I imported this file into Power BI, created additional visualizations and saved the final report as a Power BI document.
